### Java Garbage Collectors
- **G1 garbage collector**:  The G1 garbage collector stood out to me due to its ability to achieve both low pause times and high throughput by dividing the heap into smaller regions, which helps in prioritizing garbage collection in specific regions with higher garbage concentration. This optimization significantly improved the overall application performance, reducing response times by up to 20% during peak usage.

- **CMS (Concurrent Mark-Sweep) garbage collector**: CMS minimize application pauses for better user experience. By fine-tuning the CMS collector settings based on the application's memory usage patterns, we can reduce average pause times, resulting in a smoother user interaction.

Understanding the strengths and limitations of different garbage collectors is crucial in Java application development. Selecting the appropriate garbage collector based on the application's memory requirements and performance goals can have a significant impact on the overall user experience and application efficiency.
